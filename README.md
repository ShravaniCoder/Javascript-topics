# Learn-Javascript
# Welcome to the repository dedicated to my learning journey through the "Chai Aur Code" YouTube channel's fantastic tutorials on Scratch and JavaScript programming. 🚀
# This repository is a reflection of my personal experiences diving into the world of Scratch and JavaScript with the guidance of "Chai Aur Code." From my very first steps in understanding the basics to more advanced concepts, I've had the privilege of learning directly from well-crafted video tutorials that break down complex topics into easily digestible pieces.
